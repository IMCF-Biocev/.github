## About us

The **Imaging Methods Core Facility (IMCF) at Biocev** focuses on three main areas: 
- Optical (fluorescence) microscopy
- Electron microscopy
- Flow cytometry
  
We provide training and access to cutting-edge instruments, offer consulting on experimental design, sample preparation, data acquisition, and data interpretation. 
Additionally, we host microscopy courses â€” check our [webpages](https://imcf.natur.cuni.cz/IMCF/courses/) for updates.

IMCF BIOCEV is part of the **Czech-BioImaging** infrastructure, enabling open access to advanced imaging technologies and expertise for researchers in the Czech Republic and beyond.

IMCF BIOCEV is part of the Prague node of the **Euro-BioImaging** infrastructure, which offers open access, services, and training across a wide range of cutting-edge biological and medical imaging technologies.
